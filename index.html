<!-- This HTML file provides a simple example of a portfolio page. It contains a header, a few sections, and a few charts. -->
<!-- It works with the three css files in this folder: example1.css, example2.css and example3.css. -->
<!-- The HTML file defines the structure of the page, and the CSS files define how it looks. -->
<!-- The CSS examples are all designed to work with this page. Try swapping them out on line 29 and see what happens. -->

    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                I have created a github account and live page. Here I added three charts using the vegaembed function.

                I take this chart from the create function in teh EconomicsObservatory. It is a chart of Thailand's unemployment data. 
                This week I also learned about using "container" as a size for a chart, and how to code that up in the format of the site.
