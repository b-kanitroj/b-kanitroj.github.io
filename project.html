    <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 10px;">
        How do disparities in infrastructure and healthcare access impact societal challenges across Thailand's
        provinces?
    </p>
    <div
        style="background-color: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; margin-top: 15px; border-radius: 5px;">
        <p style="margin: 0;">
            <strong>Aim:</strong> This project investigates how disparities in infrastructure (e.g., road density) and
            healthcare access (e.g.,
            number of doctors per 10,000 population) affect societal challenges like health, education, and employment
            issues. The goal is to identify patterns that highlight underserved provinces, offering actionable insights
            for
            policymakers. By linking these disparities to societal issues, the project seeks to provide evidence-based
            recommendations for improving infrastructure and welfare programs according to the needs of the people.

                Healthcare access varies widely across Thailand's provinces, with some areas offering significantly
                better doctor availability than others. The global standard of <a
                    href="https://data.who.int/indicators/i/CCCEBB2/217795A" target="_blank">17.2 doctors per 10,000

                So what does the disparity mean for the people? This chart shows how doctor density impacts health
                issues and
                chronic disease prevalence. Provinces with fewer doctors face higher health challenges, with larger
                bubbles
                highlighting the dual strain of overall health issues and the long-term burden of chronic diseases in
                underserved areas.

                This map visualizes the distribution of health issues across provinces in Thailand. The intensity of color
                represents the number of reported health issues in each province, allowing for easy identification of
                regions with higher or lower health challenges. Use the dropdown filter to explore specific health issues,
                or view all health issues combined to see the overall burden across the country.

                Expanding the perspective to infrastructure, this chart explores how road density correlates with key societal
                issues such as employment and education challenges. Each panel compares one type of issue, with bubble sizes
                representing the total population in each province. The visual highlights how larger populations may either
                amplify or mitigate the impact of limited infrastructure. By juxtaposing these two societal dimensions, it
                emphasizes the compounded challenges faced by underserved regions.

                This heatmap reveals the combined influence of road and healthcare access on societal challenges. Warmer colors
                indicate higher issue intensity, pinpointing regions where limited infrastructure and healthcare access converge
                to compound challenges. By layering these two critical dimensions, the chart underscores the interconnected
                nature of infrastructure disparities and their profound effects on provincial well-being.

                <strong>Societal Issues:</strong>
                Counts of health, education, and employment issues were derived from MSO-Logbook, an individual-level
                dataset documenting
                the needs of over 900,000 people across Thailand's provinces. The raw data, available to ministry
                personnel upon request
                from the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security, required translation, parsing, and
                aggregation to create province-level summaries.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
            Although the data does not utilize APIs or fully automated pipelines, Python scripts were developed for data
            cleaning, aggregation,
            and analysis. These scripts ensure replicability with future datasets and demonstrate the potential for
            integrating disparate datasets.
            This project highlights the value of open and standardized data practices, aiming to inspire broader
            adoption of data-driven policymaking
            in Thailand. You can see the data cleaning and processing steps in my

            <strong>Challenges, Tools Used, and Limitations:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-top: 10px; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>
                <strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Cleaning the dataset required addressing missing values, resolving
                mismatched
                province names, and correcting inconsistent formatting. With over a million data points, significant
                effort
                went into aggregating and standardizing individual-level information into province-level summaries.
                Python's
                <code>pandas</code> library was instrumental in preprocessing, translating, and parsing raw datasets
                from Thai to ensure alignment across variables.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>AI Assistance:</strong> Generative AI tools significantly streamlined formatting, converting,
                and
                standardizing dataset structures. While these tools provided efficiency, manual validation was essential
                to
                ensure the accuracy of data points.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>MSO-Logbook Limitations:</strong> The data presented unique limitations. As it is collected
                through human-administered questionnaires, the dataset contains missing entries and inconsistencies,
                such as incorrectly formatted or incomplete data. Some provinces lack data entirely due to ongoing
                reviews, leading to charts that do not fully represent all provinces.
            </li>
            <li>
                The issues uncovered during this
                analysis will be shared separately with the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security to
                encourage improvements in data collection and management practices. Addressing these gaps is vital to
                enhancing the utility of this rich but underutilized dataset, enabling it to better inform future policy
                discussions and support evidence-based decision-making within the ministry.

            <strong>Conclusion: Infrastructure inequities deeply exacerbate societal challenges, leaving
            underserved provinces to grapple with compounded burdens on health, education, and employment.</strong>

            Chart 1 establishes the baseline, revealing disparities in healthcare access across provinces. This
            introduces the inequity that sets the stage for further analysis. Chart 2 demonstrates how inadequate
            healthcare infrastructure directly impacts public health.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
            Chart 4 expands the perspective to road density, showing how infrastructure disparities contribute to
            broader societal challenges, such as education and employment issues. The patterns emphasize that
            infrastructure inequities are not isolated but have effects on people’s well-being. Chart 5 reinforces this
            interconnectedness, highlighting how the combined inadequacies of road and healthcare infrastructure
            compound societal challenges, with the highest burdens seen in underserved provinces.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-weight: bold;">Policy Recommendations:</p>
        <ol style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 0;">
            <li><strong>Targeted Resource Allocation:</strong> Direct healthcare and infrastructure investments to
                provinces with the most severe disparities to maximize impact where it's needed most.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated Planning:</strong> Address the interconnected nature of infrastructure and well-being
                by coordinating improvements in healthcare access and road systems to tackle compounded challenges.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluate Welfare Policies:</strong> Current flat-rate monthly welfare may not account for
                regional disparities in infrastructure. Future research should explore how these inequities affect
                living costs and spending to inform more equitable welfare strategies.</li>
