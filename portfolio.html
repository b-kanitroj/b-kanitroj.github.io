        This page presents my portfolio of 10 coding challenges, each designed to demonstrate a range of data science skills, including data visualization, web development, and analysis. From building interactive charts and maps to implementing machine learning models and data scrapers, each task highlights a unique aspect of practical data analysis applied to real-world economic and policy topics.

    <!-- Week 1 -->
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>CC 1: Hosting. Display charts in your own site.</h2>
            <p>
                I have created a GitHub account and live page. Here I added a chart using the vegaEmbed, taken from 
                <a href="https://rdeconomist.github.io/library">Chart Library</a>.

        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>CC 2: Building. Create your own visualisations</h2>
            <p>
                I take this chart from the create function in the <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/explore">Economics Observatory</a>. It is a chart of Thailand's unemployment data. This week I also learned about using "container" as a size for a chart and how to code that up in the format of the site.

            <p>
                I took Thailand and Vietnam unemployment data from the Economics Observatory and tried to use "layer" to combine it into one chart.

        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>CC 3: Debating. Use a visualization in economic/policy commentary</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/festival-of-economics-2024">Festival of Economics 2024</a> invites economists and experts to address critical economic questions, such as: What can we do to boost Britain’s productivity? and How is the recently elected Labour government performing?
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I have created two charts to support the discussion that wealth, particularly in housing, has become a more critical issue as the difficulty of entering the housing market has reinforced disparities.

   <!-- Week 4 -->

    <div class="chart-description">
        <h2>CC 4: Replication. Re-create, then improve, someone else’s chart</h2>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="cc4_bad_chart.png" alt="Screenshot of the chart from the report" style="width: 300px; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">
        </div>
        <p>
            This is a graph showing Thailand’s budget appropriation by budget structure from fiscal year 2010–2024, taken from the 
            <a href="https://www.bb.go.th/topic-detail.php?id=16974&mid=312&catID=0">“Thailand’s Budget in Brief FY2024”</a> document.
            The budget in brief is an annual report written by the Budget Bureau with the goal to “clearly provide readers with an overall 
            picture of the budget allocation in different perspectives which are easy to understand, and convenient for further study and research”
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="chartGrid">
        
        <figure id="cc4_bad_chart"></figure>
        <figure id="cc4_good_chart"></figure>
    </div>
    <p>
        This chart aims to show the percentage of each spending type according to budget structure: current expenditures, 
        capital expenditures, replenishment of treasury accounts balance, principal repayments, and replenishment of reserve fund. 
        Knowing this appropriations would give the reader an overview of the government spending, giving insight into the priority, 
        objectives, and financial strategies. 
        
        The current chart is not very informative as the current expenditures take up the majority of the budget every year, 
        making it hard to see the changes in other spending categories. Additionally, the legend calling out the name of the 
        categories are also in the way making the already to sparse scale hard to read.

        I improved the chart by converting it into a stacked bar chart to visually represent the composition of the budget across different years. 
        This format makes it easier to compare categories over time. Additionally, I added tooltips to improve readability and provide precise values on hover. 
        To draw attention to critical areas, I highlighted specific categories in red, emphasizing the need for closer examination.

        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>CC 5: Scraper. Implement a data scraper of your own</h2>
            <p>
                I have scraped item name and price data from <a href="https://www.bigc.co.th/t">BigC Online</a>, focusing on products under the sections “Mom and baby” and “Elderly.” I built the scraper by generating links to access different pages, then used Beautiful Soup to parse and extract the data.

        <figure id="cc5_bigC"></figure>
        <p>
            This chart shows the price density plot for diapers and formula, essential items for both age groups. The price for baby items tends to cluster at the lower end of the range, possibly due to higher competition in the market.
