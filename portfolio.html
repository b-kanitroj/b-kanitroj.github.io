        This page presents my portfolio of 10 coding challenges, each designed to demonstrate a range of data science skills, including data visualization, web development, and analysis. From building interactive charts and maps to implementing machine learning models and data scrapers, each task highlights a unique aspect of practical data analysis applied to real-world economic and policy topics.

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->
    <section> <!-- WEEK1 -->
        <div class="chart-description"> 
            <h2>CC 1: Hosting. Display charts in your own site.</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I have created a github account and live page. Here I added three charts using the vegaembed function, they are taken from 
                <a href="https://rdeconomist.github.io/library"> Chart Library</a>

            <figure id="Location3"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->

    <section> <!-- WEEK2 -->
        <div class="chart-description">  <!-- WEEK2 -->
            <h2>CC 2: Building. Create your own visualisations</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I take this chart from the create function in the <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/explore"> EconomicsObservatory</a>. It is a chart of Thailand's unemployment data. 
                This week I also learned about using "container" as a size for a chart, and how to code that up in the format of the site.
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="ThaiUnemp"></figure> 
        <figure id="VietUnemp"></figure>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I take Thailand and Vietnam unemployment data from the EconomicsObservatory 
                 and try to use "layer" to combine it into one chart.
            </p>
        <figure id="THVNUnemp"></figure>
        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            I also try to create chart from scratch with data in csv format, and I will adapt that to the data of my choice in the next chart.
        </p>
        <figure id="Vicespending"></figure>

        <div class="chart-description"></div>
            <p> 
                I take the data from the National Statistics Office of Thailand through the website <a href="https://data.go.th/dataset/0704_01_0009"> Open Government Data of Thailand</a> , about the number of people the age of 60 with desirable health behavior.
                There are still problems with this chart. By using stack bar chart, the number of people in other region with desirable health outcome seem like a larger share than those in Bangkok.
                However, despite bigger numbers, they have much lower share compare to the whole population in the region. Therefore I want to try to use other chart type.
            </p>

        <figure id="DesirableHealth"></figure>
