        This page presents my portfolio of 10 coding challenges, each designed to demonstrate a range of data science skills, including data visualization, web development, and analysis. From building interactive charts and maps to implementing machine learning models and data scrapers, each task highlights a unique aspect of practical data analysis applied to real-world economic and policy topics.

            <h2>CC 1: Hosting. Display charts in your own site.</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I have created a github account and live page. Here I added three charts using the vegaembed function, they are taken from 
                <a href="https://rdeconomist.github.io/library"> Chart Library</a>

            <h2>CC 2: Building. Create your own visualisations</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I take this chart from the create function in the <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/explore"> EconomicsObservatory</a>. It is a chart of Thailand's unemployment data. 
                This week I also learned about using "container" as a size for a chart, and how to code that up in the format of the site.

        <div class="chart-description">
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                I take Thailand and Vietnam unemployment data from the EconomicsObservatory 
                 and try to use "layer" to combine it into one chart.
            </p>
        <figure id="THVNUnemp"></figure>
        <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
            I also try to create chart from scratch with data in csv format, and I will adapt that to the data of my choice in the next chart.

        <div class="chart-description"></div>
            <p> 
                I take the data from the National Statistics Office of Thailand through the website <a href="https://data.go.th/dataset/0704_01_0009"> Open Government Data of Thailand</a> , about the number of people the age of 60 with desirable health behavior.
                There are still problems with this chart. By using stack bar chart, the number of people in other region with desirable health outcome seem like a larger share than those in Bangkok.
                However, despite bigger numbers, they have much lower share compare to the whole population in the region. Therefore I want to try to use other chart type.

            <p>
                <a href="https://www.economicsobservatory.com/festival-of-economics-2024">Festival of Economics 2024</a> invites economists and experts to address critical economic questions, 
                such as: What can we do to boost Britain’s productivity? and How is the recently elected Labour government performing? 
            </p>

            <p>
                Among the topics explored is social mobility. The panel titled "(Not) Moving on Up: How Can We Increase Social Mobility?" 
                is chaired by Mehreen Khan (The Times) and features Lou Davies (Bedminster Down School), Lindsey Macmillan (University College London and the Centre for Education Policy and Equalising Opportunities), 
                Suzanne Rolt (Arnolfini), and David Sturrock (Institute for Fiscal Studies). Together, they highlights key factors influencing social mobility, 
                including education, housing and wealth inequality, labor market challenges, and gaps in policy.

                Here I have created two charts to support the discussion that Wealth, particularly in housing, has become more critical issues as the difficulty of entering the housing market has reinforced disparities.

        <figure id = "Firsttimebuyer"></figure>
        <p>
            The average age of first-time buyers shows an upward trend, reaching 33.5 years in 2022-23, highlighting growing challenges for young people entering the housing market.

            To put it in perspective, the U.K. ranks 18th out of 27 countries in the percentage of households that own their homes as of 2022.
